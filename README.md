# Project Name
Bike Sharing Assignment.


## Introduction
* Build a multi linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes.

## Problem Statement
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## The comapny wants to know: 
* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands.


## Conclusions

- holiday
- temp
- hum

- Season
- months(January, July, September, November, December)
- Year (2019)
- Sunday
- weathersit( Light Snow, Mist + Cloudy)
